# Day 4: Giant Squid

## Part 1

To guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure out which bingo board will win first. **What will the final score be if you choose the winning board?**

## Part 2

On the other hand, it might be wise to try a different strategy: let the giant squid win. Figure out which board will win last; **once that board wins, what would it's final score be?**
